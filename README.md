# SOTU

Web pages for and pages to accompany my work with Mitch Fraas on the Atlantic articles. (This is the html/js; there's a 
server-side set of Makefiles and python elsewhere that actually parses the things).

Most of the code here is dropped out from my repo at https://github.com/bmschmidt/BookwormD3 , but I've parted it out
rather than forked because there's just so much crud in there.
